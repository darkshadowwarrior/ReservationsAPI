Version 1.0.0

Api that allows a customer to reserve a parking space over a give date range, cancel a reservation, amend a reservation and check for spaces available over a given date range.

There are unit tests provided for the ReservationManager class as this class is quite complex and during development I needed confidence that any subsequent changes made would not break anything or if it did I would be notified.

The Api has also been manually tested using swagger to ensure the API is running as expected.

Total time take on this project over the course of a day was around 6 hours
